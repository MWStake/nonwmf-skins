This repository holds a number of submodules pointing to the repositories of MediaWiki sklns that are not hosted on Wikimedia's Gerrit instance.  If you want to add one, just send us a pull request.

Repositories included here will automatically be included in [https://codesearch.wmflabs.org/search/ MediaWiki code search], which is used by MediaWiki core developers when identifying usage levels during the deprecation process.

If the skin is no longer supported and does not work with any [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Version_lifecycle supported version of MediaWiki], it should be removed.

== How to add your own repository ==

The simplest thing you can do is [https://github.com/MWStake/nonwmf-skins/issues/new submit an issue] with the URL of the repository.

== How to create your own pull request ==

Of course, while your issue will get the the repository added, the '''''quickest''''' way to get your repositories added here (in other words, you'll save the maintainers of this repository from doing a lot of work) is to create a pull request that adds then to in accordance with this repository's policy.  The policy is recorded in the [[policy]] script.

To add your skin to this repository, fork this repository, check out your fork, go to the directory containing the checkout, and create a branch with the named after your skin(s).  (See [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork Creating a pull request from a fork] if you need information on how to do any of this.)

For example, to add the [https://github.com/lakejason0/mediawiki-skins-Lakeus Lakeus skin], I created a branch in my checkout:
<blockquote><pre>
$ git checkout -b Lakeus
Switched to a new branch 'Lakeus'
$
</pre></blockquote>

Next, add your skin as a submodule to the new branch using <tt>git submodule</tt>.

To add the Lakeus skin a a submodule to my branch I ran:

<blockquote><pre>
$ git submodule add https://github.com/lakejason0/mediawiki-skins-Lakeus Lakeus
Cloning into '/home/mah/work/code/mediawiki/nonwmf-skins/Lakeus'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (1612/1612), done.
$
</pre></blockquote>

This modifies your <tt>.gitmodules</tt> to add an entry for your skin and adds the submodule ready for committing.

Using <tt>git diff HEAD</tt> you should see something similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
$ git diff HEAD
diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules
index e7d380a..85b806c 100644

Now you can visit https://github.com/MWStake/nonwmf-skins/pull/new and create a pull request.

Again, refer to [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork Creating a pull reaquest from a fork] if you need information on how to do any of this.

== Updating and synchronizing the submodules ==

It isn't strictly necessary, but you can update the submodule references by using the [[update-all-submodules]] script which iterates over each submodule and calls [[update-to-primary-branch]] to update the submodule.
